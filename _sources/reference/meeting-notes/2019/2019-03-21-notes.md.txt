Agenda Items
============

1. Conversation with JOSS - should know in the next few weeks if our review process is accepted
    * they are interested in partnering with us, similar to their partnership with rOpenSci
    * when someone submits a package to pyOpenSci, they can also submit it to JOSS to get a DOI from them
        * robust review process, as compared to Zenodo DOI
        * You can have both: a DOI for the package from Zenodo and a DOI from JOSS for the paper/publication
2. Discussion of review process
    * When should a package be submitted?
        * should be fairly well-developed; if early in the package development, potential submitter should complete pre-review steps: https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/packaging/packaging_guide.html
    * pyOpenSci should provide a reason for why go through the pyOpenSci process, rather than just JOSS?
        * When someone submits -- maybe we have a curation ... support process to help people with testing , docs, etc etc
        * If we make it easier for people to submit, to setup tests, and docs etc, we might get more submissions, does rOpenSci do mentorship with testing, docs, etc etc ? FOLLOWUP with Karthik and Carl -- do they mentor submissions?
            * cookie-cutter: https://github.com/pyOpenSci/cookiecutter-pyopensci
        * Maybe look into how much hand-holding/support does rOpenSci provide for submitters?
            * maybe we help them with testing, docs, etc
            * pyOpenSci is dedicated to education around OS development, so this fits mission
            * Possibly have three categories for submission:
                * pre-submission with support (submittter requests guidance on specific tasks such as testing, docs; could also be labeled as such by the reviewer)
                * pre-submission
                * submission
        * We should allow for some flexibility in the review process -- people might be set in their ways
            * Link to current requirements: https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/packaging/packaging_guide.html#overview
            * Checklist for the reviewer after the submission issue is opened:  https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/reviewer_guide.html
            * Review Template: https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/appendices/templates.html#review-template
* What happens after a package is accepted?
    * packages goes to JOSS if it was requested and in scope for JOSS
        * technical review is done already
    * decision on where the repository will live
        * they can keep in their space if organization
        * or they can decide to port it over to pyOpenSci
    * accepted packages will be listed on pyOpenSci website and send out via social media announcements
    * One goal of pyOpenSci is provide a space/mechanism for faster discovery of packages
    * So one benefit of the review is that it is a community approved package and will now be easier for others to discover and use
3. Outreach efforts - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpAgnky2NxD0KghRhINVLmtvoaq4PCBikfHgH9HjgCI/edit
    * updates on who has reached out to whom... please update the google doc with your name and who you've contacted
4. Website (http://pyopensci.org) - how do people get involved with us?

5. Packages - we need a package or two to review!!
    * Scope: https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/aims_scope.html

## To Do:
* rOpenSci -- has discourse forum to answer questions. it might be better to document things here! we could set this up.
* Filipe will submit a package to the review process
* Should we submit earthpy? or something else?
