https://hackmd.io/sLhsQOtoTCq7594xNapLWg#

## Attendees
* Leah Wasser
* Kylen Solvik
* Jenny Palomino
* Chris Holdgraf
* Max Joseph
* Carson Farmer


## AGENDA

### Cookie Cutter Python package updates (Kylen)
* Packaging guide
    * a template to make it easier for someone to setup core package infrastructure with
        * testing - pytest
        * CI -- Travis, Circle, Azure
	    * should have CI for all platforms; our cookie cutter does not do this right now
	        * good, better, and best model
	        * provide minimal req to perfect example
		        * ex: how to test on Windows is still tricky
	    * Hopefully people will want to contribute to help with CI and testing protocols
        * read the docs documentation
            * autodoc...
        * what else???
    * Minimize difference between our template and the cookiecutter template
        * Ensure it's easy to merge in upstream changes
        * Removing things is probably fine

### Project Scope - in the review processing & guidelines
* https://pyopensci.github.io/dev_guide/peer_review/peer_review_proc#aims-and-scope

#### Current Scope List

* Data retrieval: Packages for accessing and downloading data from online sources. Includes wrappers for accessing APIs.
* Data extraction: Packages that aid in retrieving data from unstructured sources such as text, images and PDFs.
* Data munging: Tools for processing data from scientific data formats.
* Data deposition: Tools for depositing data in scientific research repositories.
* Data visualization: Packages for visualizing and analyzing data.
* Reproducibility: Tools to scientists ensure that their research is reproducible. E.g. version control, automated testing, or citation tools.
* Geospatial: Packages focused on the retrieval, manipulation, and analysis of spatial data.
* Education: Packages to aid with instruction.
* Statistics/Machine Learning: Packages implementing established ML or statistics methods. Note that this does not include new methods, only implementations of previously published algorithms/techniques.

Comments
* Max: let's follow what ropensci is doing; ML may be hard to test (e.g. stochastic algorithms)
* Chris: ML is more complex, may be hard to get reviewers;
* rOpenSci doesn't include data viz -- do we want to include that or consider that??
    * Chris will ask Karthik about not including data viz in rOpenSci
    * Geoplot -- as an example... https://github.com/ResidentMario/geoplot

### Dev guide feedback
* https://pyopensci.github.io/dev_guide
    * Comment on the 2 pull req?
        * https://github.com/pyOpenSci/dev_guide/pull/2
        * https://github.com/pyOpenSci/dev_guide/pull/4
    * Comments on scope and package guide from the group would be helpful
    * COC -- exists but should be more highlighted in the dev-guide...

### BOF -- SciPy proposed session - summer
* Submission form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNO_scayKeQapQxZRNeFOqql35HY9nRc6gCpxEk8VkZBAkLQ/viewform
    * asks for Moderator, Title, Abstract, Format = Open Discussion
        * March 18, 2019: BoF call for submissions opens
        * Jun 18, 2019: BoF submissions due
        * Jul 10-12, 2019: SciPy 2019 General Conference
* Can we spend some time thinking about how people can engage with us...
    *  Mozilla concept of Mountain of Engagement
* Can we get the **BOF text from last year from Paige???**

### JOSS (UPDATE)
* Leah reports successful/positive conversation; will follow up more

### Presubmission template added!
* https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/presubmission-inquiry.md
    * https://github.com/ropensci/software-review
    * reviewer database??? rOpenSci has one to keep track of reviewers, their last review, etc (uses https://airtable.com/)
    * analog to rOpenSci software review repo (there is also an onboarding repo once the package is accepted)
    * https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyApiToolkit/issues/1 -- USER: https://github.com/simkimsia
    * Should treat this first submission as a partnership to help the pyOpenSci submission workflow; ask the user for feedback; help us develop a proof of concept
